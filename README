This is a neat little interface to play with the World Cup statistics released by the Guardian:
http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/jul/09/world-cup-2010-statistics

It used YQL (http://developer.yahoo.com) to convert the data and YUI (http://developer.yahoo.com/yui) 
for the layout and functionality.

Nothing amazing, but fun to do :)
